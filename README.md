Medical office scheduling system
---

I created an app that presents concepts specific to OOP in Java which includes : Encapsulation, Inheritance , Polymorphism, Overriding, Abstraction, Collections, Comparators, etc. I created services that use JDBC to store the data in a database. The project is a medical office scheduling system application where you cand logIn as a client. admin and register. The application has a menu in which you can find options such as: 
* viewing the current list of medical clinics 
* viewing informations about a particular clinic 
* viewing informations about all doctors 
* we cand create an appointment 
* see al my appointments
* modify the data of an apointment 
* delete an appointment
